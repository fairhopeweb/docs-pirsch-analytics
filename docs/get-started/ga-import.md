# Importing Your Statistics From Google Analytics

You can import existing data from Google Universal Analytics (GA3). To import your data, follow these steps

1. Click on **Continue with Google**, this will redirect you to sign in with the Google account you want to connect with
2. Select the account that has access to your Google Analytics property
3. Grant access to your analytics data
4. Confirm your choices on the next screen
5. When you are taken back to the settings page, select the website you want to import and choose a start and end date
6. Click **Start Import** to start the import.

The import will run in the background and will take a while to complete. Note that you cannot import data after the creation date of a dashboard. If you set the end date after the creation date of your dashboard (the first day your website started using Pirsch), it will be overwritten with the creation date of your website. This is to ensure that you don't accidentally mix up your data.
