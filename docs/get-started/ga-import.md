# Importing Your Statistics From Google Analytics

You can import existing data from Google Universal Analytics (GA3). Follow these steps to import your data:

1. click on *Continue with Google*, this will redirect you to login with the Google account you would like to use to connect
2. select the account that has access to your property on Google Analytics
3. grant access to your analytics data
4. confirm the choices on the next screen
5. after you have been redirected back to the settings page, select the website you would like to import and chose a start and end date
6. click *Start Import* to start the import

The import will run in the background and it take a while to complete. Note that you cannot import data after the creation date of a dashboard. Setting the end date after the creation date of your dashboard (the first day your website started using Pirsch) will overwrite it with the creation date of your website. This is to ensure you don't accedentially mix data.
