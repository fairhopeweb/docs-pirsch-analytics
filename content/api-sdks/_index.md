Pirsch offers an API to store page hits, manage access, read statistics, and more. You can use these features to implement your own applications on top of it and analyze your websites traffic from your backend. We also provide client SDKs to make it easier for you to work with our API. They are available for different programming languages, please check the list on the left to pick the one you need.
