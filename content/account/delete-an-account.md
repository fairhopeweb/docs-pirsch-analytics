We are sad to see you go, but we will happily remove your personal and website data from our database, if you decide to leave Pirsch behind. As of today, there is no button you can click to archieve this. Please write us a short email to [support@pirsch.io](mailto:support@pirsch.io) and we will proceed with the deletion - usually within a couple of hours. 

Make sure to use the email address linked to your account to verify the action.
