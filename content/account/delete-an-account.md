If you wish to delete your account and all data we collected for you, visit the account settings page (top right on the dashboard) and scroll to the bottom. Click on the *Delete Your Account* button.

If you have an active subscription, it will be cancelled immediately. Note that we do not give refunds for any outstanding balance. The account and all data belonging to it will be marked for deletion. You have one week to cancel the action. Should you decide to do so, you need to reactivate your subscription manually afterwards.
