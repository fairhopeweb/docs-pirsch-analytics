## Delete Data

You can delete all or parts of the statistics for a specific domain. Click on *Delete Data* and select the time frame you would like to use. Afterwards, select the statistics you would like to delete or all.

## Transfer Ownership

In case you would like to transfer the ownership for the website, click on *Transfer Ownership* and enter the email address of the new owner. The new owner must have an account at Pirsch and accept the transfer from the dashboard. Please note that the new owner must have an active subscription (or an active free-trial) to collect statistics for the new website. The page views will count towards the subscription of the new owner after the transfer has been accepted.

## Delete Your Domain

This action will delete all statistics, access to the dashboard, and free up the subdomain. Note that deleting a domain is permanent, we won't keep any of your data.
