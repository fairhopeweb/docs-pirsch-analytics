Welcome to the documentation for [Pirsch](https://pirsch.io/), a simple, privacy-friendly, open-source alternative to Google Analytics that does not rely on cookies. We are based in Germany and the core of Pirsch is [open-source](https://github.com/pirsch-analytics/pirsch).

This documentation provides all the details you need to get started using Pirsch. It describes how you can integrate it on your website to analyze traffic, general usage of the user interface, and the API. A good place to start is the [Get Started]({{<  ref "get-started/_index.md"  >}}) section, which describes how you can set it up.

In case you find a mistake or outdated documentation, you can contact us by email ([support@pirsch.io](mailto:support@pirsch.io)) or on Twitter [@PirschAnalytics](https://twitter.com/PirschAnalytics).

This documentation is [open-source](https://github.com/pirsch-analytics/docs) and uses a custom built [Hugo theme](https://github.com/pirsch-analytics/seeker), which you can use too if you like it.
